# ITLegend for test ui grid

## 📦 Installation

Install all project dependencies by running:

```sh
yarn
```

---

## 🚀 Development Mode

Start the application in development mode with hot reloading:

```sh
yarn dev
```

This will run **Vite** and watch for file changes.

---

## 🛠️ Linting & Formatting

### 🔍 Lint Code

Check the code for ESLint rule violations and automatically fix them:

```sh
yarn lint
```

### 🎨 Format Code

Format the code using **Prettier**:

```sh
yarn format
```

---

## 📜 Type Checking

Check TypeScript types without emitting files:

```sh
yarn tsc
```

This helps catch type-related errors early in development.

---

## 📸 Production Build

Generate a production-ready build of the application:

```sh
yarn build
```

This command first compiles TypeScript (`tsc -b`) and then builds the project using **Vite**.

---

## 👀 Preview Production Build

After building, preview the production version locally:

```sh
yarn preview
```

This allows testing of the production build in a local environment.

---

## 💬 Commit Management

Use **Git-CZ** to create structured commits following conventional commit standards:

```sh
yarn commit
```
